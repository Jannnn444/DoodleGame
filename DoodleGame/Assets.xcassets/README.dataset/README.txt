Hi!
These are all the images (and colours) that you'll need for the app.

For the images, drag them into your app's Assets within Xcode. Make sure to set their Scaling to "Single Scale" in the properties pane on the right side of the Xcode window.

The colours can be simply dragged into your Assets - no changes needed.


Thanks!
